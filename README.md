# World_Weather_Analysis
The purpose of this repository was to gather random latitudes and longitudes to get a list of cities around their world and their weather conditions. And this was done using APIs from Openweather and GoogleMaps. GoogleMaps outputs were generated with various heat maps to show what weather conditions were for the cities gathered from the longitudes/latitudes. 

This was then used for a vacation website so customers can input their preferred weather conditions when searching for a vacation destination.
